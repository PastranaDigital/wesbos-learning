# Notes

Installed the _Markdown All-in-One_ extension for VSCode

I'm **super excited**

## Paragraphs
- need a full empty line between if you want there to be a space 

### Examples

These two lines do not have a full
empty line between them in the file.

These two lines do have a full

empty line between them in the file.


## Italics 
- Can be done with single *asterisks* or with _underline_
- I changed the Italics Indicator in the Markdown settings to _underline_


## Bold
- Can be done with double **asterisks** or with __underline__
- I will use **asterisks** for Bold


## Strikethrough
- this requires double ~~tildas~~
